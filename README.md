# Overview over my GitHub Site

Welcome to my GitHub Site. Here, I want to provide some information about [myself](PersonalInfo.md) 
and give an overview about my public repositories on GitHub. 

Beside my [main profile](https://github.com/StefanSchade) I keep [a second profile](https://github.com/StefanSchadeDev) on GitHub to simulate the collaboration
with other developers on my repos. Just in case you wonder about the comits of this familiar sounding user ;-)

## Public Repositories

### Basics

* The [Java Adventure Game](https://github.com/StefanSchade/Java-AdventureGame.git) is dedicated 
to developing a simple text adventure in Java with the possibility of adding framework functionality 
or graphics later on. The main objective is to use GitHub's functionality to support project management
(issues, boards, merge requests) and software development (Working with branches, showcase GitHubs CI/CD 
capabilities). We also want to practice Clean Code principles. Probably most interesting for inexperienced developers - 
Contributions are welcome.
